TODO (.kicad_pcb)
-----------------

Route the thing, make sure it passes DRC and there are no unconnected stuff

Features to add/remove
----------------------

Measure whether EN_XMEM does anything
- consider changing it to be A16 for 128k bankswitched RAM
- base draw = bootloader, 7.1 mA @ 24V if no FMs installed (170 mW)
- current draw with EN_XMEM enabled increases to 10.3 mA (247 mW)
- current draw with EN_XMEM and EN_APWR enabled and no FMs installed is 25.9 mA (622 mW)
- installing one FM makes this difference even larger: 9.4 -> 43.4 mA (226 -> 1042 mW)
- conclusion: the ~3 mA (77 mW) from EN_XMEM is a drop in the ocean

Test analog inputs, make sure system voltages can be measured

DONE
----

Use same diodes as fm10 (SMA doesn't roll)

Make all protection resistors 1206, 0 Ohm. Fit only one where there are multiple ones

Set fit_field where relevant
- remove some 10u's since we use 0 Ohm everywhere
- replace some 10u's with 100n

Assign PF5/6 LEDs to some other pins
- nah

Maybe make more connections straight to the ÂµC instead of through 74153
- PD0 and PD1 to TACH0/TACH1 for example

Create FTSH-112-04 footprint with third row of holes behind current ones
- must use the same origin

Move connectors out 0.25 mm
- this makes the board backward compatible with the thinner fm9 boards

Deepen routed out stuff near connectors by 1.27-0.25 = 1.22 mm

Move lower mounting hole on side opposite of female header to the same height as the hole next to the header
- this to help allen wrench clear the stud
