Leaded solder only

Stackup in UMU_180430.pdf

- total thickness is 3.76 mm (want 4.0 mm but not possible, will shim)
- fieldmill10-inner3-back.drl are holes to be Z-drilled to a depth of 1.5 mm (not plated)

All parts must tolerate +125°C

- MAX504 is an exception since it is only available up to +85°C

Ceramic capacitors MUST use soft termination

- 47u must be rated at least 4V
- 10u35V must be rated at least 35V
- all others must rated at least 10V
- automotive grade preferred

There are indeed zero ohm resistors in 0805 and 1206 packages
