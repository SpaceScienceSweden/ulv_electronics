Separate fab and asm instructions
Get TMR 3WI series +-5V switchers, they're rated up to +85°C
- ITQ2405S from XP Power is even better, operating up to 100°C (starts derating at 70°C)
- CUI Inc. have some parts that go up to 105°C, like PRMC3-D24-D5-S, but they require +18V minimum
Replacing THN 30WI with THN 15WIR (90°C max) may be tempting, but keep in mind:
- motors are rated at 5W, so three of them hit the 15W limit
- peak current draw of motors is 580 mA (14 W)
- this means turning a motor on while the other two are running may overload a 15W module
- Artesyn's AXA00H18-L give is rated up to 85°C, but also only 20W
- in short, can't really use anything other than THN 30WI in the current size

DONE

BOM
- all industrial parts
- this can't actually be done, because the +-5V regulator tops out at 71°C
  the TMR 3WI series goes up to +85°C however
- the +24V regulator is +80°C max
- all other parts are +85°C max or higher however, which should be OK


Use film capacitors for AVCC and AREF

Route the thing, make sure it passes DRC and there are no unconnected stuff

Measure whether EN_XMEM does anything
- consider changing it to be A16 for 128k bankswitched RAM
- base draw = bootloader, 7.1 mA @ 24V if no FMs installed (170 mW)
- current draw with EN_XMEM enabled increases to 10.3 mA (247 mW)
- current draw with EN_XMEM and EN_APWR enabled and no FMs installed is 25.9 mA (622 mW)
- installing one FM makes this difference even larger: 9.4 -> 43.4 mA (226 -> 1042 mW)
- conclusion: the ~3 mA (77 mW) from EN_XMEM is a drop in the ocean

Test analog inputs, make sure system voltages can be measured
- works so long as pull-ups are disabled

Use same diodes as fm10 (SMA doesn't roll)

Make all protection resistors 1206, 0 Ohm. Fit only one where there are multiple ones

Set fit_field where relevant
- remove some 10u's since we use 0 Ohm everywhere
- replace some 10u's with 100n

Assign PF5/6 LEDs to some other pins
- nah

Maybe make more connections straight to the µC instead of through 74153
- PD0 and PD1 to TACH0/TACH1 for example

Create FTSH-112-04 footprint with third row of holes behind current ones
- must use the same origin

Move connectors out 0.25 mm
- this makes the board backward compatible with the thinner fm9 boards

Deepen routed out stuff near connectors by 1.27-0.25 = 1.22 mm

Move lower mounting hole on side opposite of female header to the same height as the hole next to the header
- this to help allen wrench clear the stud
