TODO (.sch)
-----------

Use same diodes as fm10 (SMA doesn't roll)

Set fit_field where relevant

Make all protection resistors 1206, 0 Ohm. Fit only one where there are multiple ones

Assign PF5/6 LEDs to some other pins

Maybe make more connections straight to the ÂµC instead of through 74153


TODO (.kicad_pcb & footprints)
-----------------

Create FTSH-112-04 footprint with third row of holes behind current ones
- must use the same origin

Move connectors out 0.25 mm
- this makes the board backward compatible with the thinner fm9 boards

Deepen routed out stuff near connectors by 1.27-0.25 = 1.22 mm

Move lower mounting hole on side opposite of female header to the same height as the hole next to the header
- this to help allen wrench clear the stud
