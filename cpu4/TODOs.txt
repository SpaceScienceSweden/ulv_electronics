-----------------

Create FTSH-112-04 footprint with third row of holes behind current ones
- must use the same origin

Move connectors out 0.25 mm
- this makes the board backward compatible with the thinner cpu3 boards

Deepen routed out stuff near connectors by 1.27-0.25 = 1.22 mm

Move lower mounting hole on side opposite of female header to the same height as the hole next to the header
- this to help allen wrench clear the stud
